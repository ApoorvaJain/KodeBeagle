## Installation instructions.

### Step 1 Configuration.
Update the configuration in application.properties

### Step 2 Run.

BetterDocs is built by [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)

`$ sbt`
`$ > project core`
`$ > run`

Then select `com.betterdocs.spark.CreateIndexJob` to run the Spark job that creates index which can be digested by elasticsearch.

### Step 3 Upload to elastic Search.

Please install elasticsearch from [here](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/elkdownloads/).
Once the elasticsearch service is running "locally". Run,

`$ bin/upload_to_es.sh`

This will upload the index generated by the job in previous step to elastic search server.
